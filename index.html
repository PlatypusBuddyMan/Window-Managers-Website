        <h2>What is a window manager? (According to Wikipedia)</h1>
        <p>"A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface."</p>

        <h2> What is that supposed to mean? </h2>
        <p> Window managers render and organize the apps that are open on your screen. Resizing, minimizing, and moving windows around the screen are all things window managers do. </p>

        <p> There are floating/stacking window managers & tiling window managers.</p>

        <h2> What is my favorite window manager?</h2>
        <p> bspwm is my favorite window manager. I like it because it is very configurable and easy to make look nice. A screenshot of my configuration of it can be found in the page on tiling window managers.</p>
